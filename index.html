<h1> About WISP </h1>
  <p>The Women In STEM Paper (WISP) is a newsletter written by girls in STEM <i>for</i> girls in STEM.<br>
  Our monthly publication includes articles written by aspiring Women in STEM about a niche field that interests them. <br>
  This allows contributors to develop skills in researching their topic, and also in academic writing.</p>
