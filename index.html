    <p>Hi! My name is Ellie Males and I founded WISP, because of my passion for helping more young women into STEM fields. My main subject areas are maths and physics, I specialise in calculus as well as theoretical physics and cosmology. I love fashion almost as much as I love physics and I hope to help others see physics with the same beauty I do. </p>
  <h3>Esther</h3>
